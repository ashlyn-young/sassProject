I'll be writing here what I feel went well or what I struggled with most through this project.

At least at one point I stopped having SASS watch the changes I was making and I decided it would be easiest to copy the work I had at that point and create a totally new SASS/CSS files!

I haven't gotten totally used to using the 'watch SASS' function, but have at least recognized it before writing too much code. I'm definitely doing better with it than when I first started!
